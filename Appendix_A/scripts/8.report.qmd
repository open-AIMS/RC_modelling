##### Leave-out-data analysis
The leave-out data approach is used to evaluate the influence of specific observations using prediction-performance measures. The full model is fitted on a train dataset composed of a random sample of observations and prediction-performance measures are computed on the leave-out observations.   

We found that the predictive performance of the spatio-temporal model is more sensitive to the number of monitoring locations, with accuracy declining when sites or reefs are removed from the dataset (@fig-p_perf). In contrast, model performance is less affected by the number of replicated years.

Five validation tests are developed: 

* 1. rm(20% obs): 20% of data were randomly removed without structure.
* 2. rm(20% reef): 20% of reefs were randomly removed.
* 3. rm(20% site): 20% of sites were randomly removed.
* 4. rm(20% transect):  20% of transects were randomly removed.
* 5. rm(5YRS): 5 years of observations were removed within each location (locations with less than 4 years of data were not used). 

Four predictive measures are used: 

* 95% coverage interval (Cvg): evaluates how often predictions include true observations, with the goal of capturing the true values 95% of the time. It is estimated as follows: 

$$
\text{coverage95}(z, \ell, u) \;=\; 
\left| 0.95 \;-\; \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbf{1}\!\left( \ell_i < z_i < u_i \right) \right|
$$

where $z = \{z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n\}$ are the coral cover observations, $\ell$ and $u$ are the lower and upper bounds of the predictive intervals, $n$ the total number of predictions, and $\mathbf{1}(\cdot)$ is the indicator function (1 if the condition is true, 0 otherwise).

* 95% interval score (IS): rewards prediction intervals that include the true observations (accuracy) and penalizes those that are too narrow or too wide (precision). It is computed as follow: 

$$
\text{IS}_{95} \;=\; \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} 
\Bigg[
(u_i - \ell_i)
+ \frac{2}{\alpha} (\ell_i - y_i)\,\mathbf{1}(y_i < \ell_i)
+ \frac{2}{\alpha} (y_i - u_i)\,\mathbf{1}(y_i > u_i)
\Bigg]
$$

where $\alpha = 0.05$, $\ell$ and $u$ are the lower and upper bounds of the predictive intervals, $n$ the total number of predictions, and $y$ are observed coral cover. 

* Root-mean-squared prediction error (RMSPE) - how far off model predictions are from true observations without considering for uncertainty.

$$
\text{RMSPE} \;=\; \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 }
$$

where $y$ and $\hat{y}$ are the observed and predicted coral cover values, respectively, and $n$ the total number of observations. 

* Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) - represents the quality of the predictions over the entire predictive probability distribution penalizing predictions that are inaccurate, imprecise or overconfident.  

$$
\text{CRPS}(F, y) \;=\; \sigma \left[ 
z \left( 2 \Phi(z) - 1 \right) \;+\; 2 \,\phi(z) \;-\; \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}
\right],
\quad z = \frac{y - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

where $y$ is the observed coral cover values, $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and the standard deviation of the predictive normal distribution, $\phi(.)$ represented the standard normal probability density function and $\Phi$ the cumulative distribution function. 

These predictive measures give a single number with low scores representing better performances.

##### Basis function exploratory analysis
The aim of this analysis is to explore the influence of the basis function formulation with a focus on the temporal dimension. To do this, we compare four model performance using different number of basis functions in the temporal basis function: 

* Full: number and location of temporal basis functions automatically estimated from the FRK function and adopted by ReefCloud.
* 5: five temporal basis functions randomly selected from the FRK auto basis function. 
* 3: three temporal basis functions randomly selected from the FRK auto basis function. 
* 1: one temporal basis function randomly selected from the FRK auto basis function. 

We found that the estimation of regional trends (@fig-bf-region) is more strongly influenced by the number of temporal basis functions, whereas the attribution of coral loss (@fig-bf-dist) is less affected.
